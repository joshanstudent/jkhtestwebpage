						<h2>Welcome</h2>
						<p>To Milford Mill United Methodist Church</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/image_10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>We are so blessed and grateful that you are visiting our website. We are extremely excited about the ministries we currently have at Milford Mill and we are even more enthusiastic about the possibilities our new vision has for the growth in the community.</p>
					<p>We invite you to join our diverse and wholesome family of worshipers here at Milford Mill UMC. We have an exceptional Child Development Center, a Dynamic Music Ministry with over five choirs and a fellowship of believers that is comparable to none—and the pastor’s not bad either, LOL.</p>&nbsp;

					<header class="major special">
						<h2>Who We Are</h2>
						<p>We have a diverse and blended congregation that is appealing to seekers, young adults and older saints. We work together to welcome children of God with warm hearts. Since 1950, Milford Mill has served as a beacon for the community and its congregation. </p>
					</header>
					<p>Many members began their Christian journey here and continue to drive great distances to be a part of this community & congregation. Guest always comments on our welcoming praxis. Milford Mill provides many opportunities to reach, nurture and serve its community.</p><p>Our music ministry has a strong presence in each service with a diversity of music: handbell choirs, children's and youth choirs, gospel choir, adult sanctuary choir, and a men's quartet. Our youth programs and Sunday school have provided both fellowship and fun for children of all ages. In addition, Milford Mill has a seniors group for parishioners 50 and over, a young adult group for parishioners 18–35, and the Evening Stars Woman's Circle. All church committees and ministries are all welcoming which is key to our continued growth.</p>

						<h2>Our History</h2>
						<p>In 1953, as a mission program at Walbrook Memorial Evangelical United Brethren Church, Milford Mill Church was established by dedicated Christians who answered a call to serve their Lord in a growing community.  </p>
					</header>
					<p>The E.U.B. and Methodist Churches merged in 1968, and Milford Mill United Methodist Church assumed its membership in the Baltimore Conference of the United Methodist Church. Milford is now a multicultural and generational congregation in a suburban context with a beautiful campus consisting of a historical children's development center, a chapel, a 250 seat sanctuary and a parsonage. Worship is Spirit lead with 5 choirs and a learned pastor with a compassion for people and holistic health.</p>
