						<h2>Our Pastor</h2>
						<p>REV. MARLON B. TILGHMAN</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The Rev. Marlon B. Tilghman is the pastor of Milford Mill United Methodist Church in Pikesville, MD. Milford Mill UMC is a multi-cultural and multi-generational congregation with a membership of over 400 members.</p>
					<p>Rev. Tilghman is a Full Elder in the Baltimore-Washington Conference of The United Methodist Church; he is the chairman of the Baltimore Suburban District of Building and Locations Committee; the Secretary of Committee on Finance and Administration for the Baltimore-Washington Annual Conference and a member of the Baltimore Suburban District Committee of Ordained Ministry for the BWCUMC. He is a member of the Baltimore Regional Initiative Developing Genuine Equality (BRIDGE) of Maryland—a Faith Based Community Action Organization; a board member of the Night of Peace Shelter, Inc. (a family homeless shelter) and he is the chaplain for the Black Professional Men, Inc. He was interviewed in 2014 as a leader in multi-ethnic congregations by the Religious Leadership and Diversity Project out of Ohio State University.</p>
					<p>Rev. Tilghman is a graduate of Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. He has a Bachelors of Architecture degree from Howard University and a Masters of Divinity degree from Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C. Rev. Tilghman retired from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as an architect and project manager in 2009. He was honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps Reserves as a Staff Sergeant and he is a veteran of Operation Desert Storm. He met his best friend and wife Barbette when they both served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves. Together they have three adult sons and a granddaughter.</p><p>Rev. Tilghman gave his life to Christ at the age of twelve in a small Holiness church on the eastern shores of Maryland, pastored by his Uncle and Exhorter Freddie Bryant.  He accepted his call to ministry on Palm Sunday, April 13, 2003 at his home church Northwood-Appold UMC after his second trial sermon. While at Northwood-Appold he served as a trustee, a lay servant and the president of the usher’s board for over 3 years.</p><p>The cornerstone of his service for God is grounded in Proverbs 3:5-6 “Trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not unto thy own understanding. But in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall make thy path straight.”</p><p>Rev. Tilghman has a heart for people, a call to draw others to Christ through servant leadership and social action. “For I have come to bear witness to the light that is Christ Jesus”—John the Baptizer.</p><p>Rev. Tilghman believes that his role of pastoral leadership is to name the reality that exists in the people he is called to serve. By naming that reality, God’s vision will flourish in the hearts and actions of humankind. “Therefore, search your heart and listen to your soul; and let your light shine so that other may be lead to Christ and lead from the darkness of their sins. To God be the Glory”—Amen!</p>
